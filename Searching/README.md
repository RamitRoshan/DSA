# Searching Algorithms in Java

### Q). What is Linear Search Algorithm?
Linear Search algorithm, is a simple search algorithm that checks each element in a list or array one by one until it 
finds the target element or reaches at the end of the list.

``
Linear Search is very simple, it says start searching from the 1st element till you find the element,you are looking for.
``


---

### ðŸ”¹ Steps of Linear Search
1. Start from the first element of the array.
2. Compare each element with the target value.
3. If a match is found â†’ return the index.
4. If no match is found after checking all elements â†’ return `-1`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Time Complexity
- **Best Case**: `O(1)` â†’ element found at the first position.
- **Worst Case**: `O(n)` â†’ element not present or at the last position.
- **Average Case**: `O(n)`

### ðŸ”¹ Space Complexity
- `O(1)` â†’ no extra space needed.

---

### ðŸ”¹ When to Use Linear Search
- When the array is **unsorted**.
- When the dataset is **small**.
- Simple and easy to implement.


### ðŸ”¹ Advantages

Works on both sorted and unsorted arrays.

Very easy to implement.

--- 
### ðŸ”¹ Disadvantages

Slow for large datasets compared to Binary Search.

Time-consuming when the array size is large.

## ðŸ”¹ Java Example Code
```java
class LinearSearchExample {
    public static int linearSearch(int[] arr, int target) {
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] == target) {
                return i; // return index
            }
        }
        return -1; // not found
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {10, 25, 30, 45, 50};
        int target = 30;

        int result = linearSearch(nums, target);

        if (result == -1) {
            System.out.println("Element not found");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Element found at index: " + result);
        }
    }
}
```

# Binary Search 

### Q). What is Binary Search Algorithm?
Binary Search is defined as a searching algorithm, used in a **sorted array** by repeatedly dividing the search interval
in half. 


### Time and Space Complexity
TC: Best â†’ O(1), Average/Worst â†’ O(log n)

SC: Iterative â†’ O(1), Recursive â†’ O(log n)


# Order-Agnostic Binary Search

**"Order-agnostic"** means it doesnâ€™t care whether the array is sorted in ascending or descending order.

The algorithm first checks the order of sorting, and then applies the correct binary search logic accordingly.


## âš¡ Steps of Order-Agnostic Binary Search

1. **Check order of array**
    ```java
    boolean isAsc = array[start] < array[end];
    ```
    - If `true` â†’ array sorted **ascending**
    - If `false` â†’ array sorted **descending**

2. **Binary search logic changes depending on order**

   **Ascending case:**
    - If `target < mid` â†’ search left
    - If `target > mid` â†’ search right

   **Descending case:**
    - If `target > mid` â†’ search left
    - If `target < mid` â†’ search right

3. Continue until element is found or search space is empty.

## âœ… Example

**Array in Ascending order:**
```text
[-18, -12, -4, 0, 2, 3, 4, 15, 16, 18, 22, 45, 89]
target = 22

â†’ Found at index 10
 
```

**Array in Descending order:**
```text

[99, 80, 75, 60, 50, 30, 10, 0, -5, -20]
target = 50


â†’ Found at index 4
